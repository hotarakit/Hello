	    <h1> My Portfolio </h1>
	    <p><strong>Welcome to my portfolio!</strong></p>
	    <p> My name is Patrick Hotarakit, I'm currently a High School Senior enrolled in Web & App Development shop class. I'm 17 years old and in my current shop class, I excel in creating website pages using HTML and CSS languages, the JavaScript part is currently a complex work to me but I'll get used to it which would take me approximately about 5 years to learn and practice from the begining of my Senior Year and after 5 years, I would expect myself to know almost all the selectors, references, and even elements from every coding languages as well as knowing all the fuctions of event handelers in order for me to build every single website page. Everytime I build a website page, I started off with popcode since popcode is a free open-sorce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editor which serves its purpose in creating official webpage projects helping anybody learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript easily without any complex meaning that if someone made a mistake while in the process of code editing, Popcode would remind any mistakes made while coding by reminding them with a red light before previewing a webpage that they've already created. And not only that, anyone can use popcode as practice course which leads to learning every strategies on how to build as many as real, fun, and satisfying website pages using your own resources such as what you have learned from popcode without relying on any third-party website builders such as WIX, Foursquare, Squarespace, etc.</p>
