	    <p><strong>Welcome to my portfolio!</strong></p>
	    <p> I'm currently a High School Senior enrolled in Web & App Development shop class. I'm 17 years old and in my current shop class, I excel in creating website pages using HTML and CSS languages, the JavaScript part is currently a complex work to me but I'll get used to it which would take me approximately about 5 years to learn and practice from the begining of my Senior Year and after 5 years, I would expect myself to know almost all the selectors, references, and even elements from every coding languages as well as knowing all the fuctions of event handelers in order for me to build every single website page.   </p>
